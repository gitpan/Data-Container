NAME
    Data::Container - Base class for objects containing a list of items

VERSION
    version 1.100840

SYNOPSIS
        package My::Container;
        use parent 'Data::Container';
        # ...

        package main;
        my $container = My::Container->new;
        $container->items_push('some_item');

DESCRIPTION
    This class implements a container object. The container can contain any
    object, scalar or reference you like. Typically you would subclass
    Data::Container and implement custom methods for your specific
    container.

    When the container is stringified, it returns the concatenated
    stringifications of its items, each two items joined by two newlines.

METHODS
  items_set_push
    Like "items_push()", and it also takes a list of items to push into the
    container, but it doesn't push any items that are already in the
    container (items are compared deeply to determine equality).

  item_grep
    Given a package name, it returns those items from the container whose
    "ref()" is equal to that package name.

    For example, your container could contain some items of type
    "My::Item::Foo" and some of type "My::Item::Bar". If you only want a
    list of the items of type "My::Item::Foo", you could use:

        my @foo_items = $container->item_grep('My::Item::Foo');

  stringify
    Stringifies the data container by concatenating the items together,
    separated by an empty line.

  prepare_comparable
    Adds support for Data::Comparable by autovivifying the container items
    array.
